# Travel Assistant - Country Recommendations and Visa Information

This project provides a recommendation system to help users choose countries based on their safety preferences, visa requirements, flight information, weather conditions, and more. It uses data from external APIs and CSV files to generate recommendations tailored to the user's preferences.



## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive travel assistant that takes into account:
- Safety preferences (based on the Global Peace Index).
- Visa requirements (checking if the user can travel to a destination without a visa).
- Flight cost estimation (getting flight details between two locations).
- Weather conditions (checking if the destination's weather fits the user's preference).
- Country descriptions (fetching Wikipedia summaries for destinations).

The system uses several external APIs and CSV data files to gather the necessary information.
